Test Project: Weather Alert Bot

Build a Python bot that:
`Pulls weather data from OpenWeatherMap API (free tier)`
`Logs forecasts to a Google Sheet with clean, visual formatting` `Posts to Slack when snow or storms are expected`

Details:
`Track weather for: New York City`
`Run hourly (or on-demand)`
`Log to Google Sheet: date/time, temp, conditions, wind, precipitation chance`
`Make the sheet visually clean and easy to scan (conditional formatting, good layout) - show off your Excel/Sheets skills`
`Slack message example: Snow storm expected tomorrow night in NYC - 28°F, 6-8 inches, high winds"`

Requirements:
`Set up your own API keys (OpenWeatherMap, Google Sheets API, Slack webhook)` `Create a GitHub repo and share with me: eugeneT96`
`Include README with setup instructions`
`Should run as a Python script I can execute`
`AI tools: Use ChatGPT/Claude to help you build this. If you need API credits, let me know - but if you're proficient, you probably have access already.`
